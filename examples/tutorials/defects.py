# Supercell creation
# ==================
#
# Background
# ----------
#
# Defect properties are most commonly investigated in the so-called
# dilute limit, i.e. under conditions, in which defect-defect
# interactions are negligible. While alternative approaches in
# particular embedding techniques exist, the most common approach is to
# use supercells. To this end, one creates a supercell by a *suitable*
# (see below) repetition of the primitive unit cell, after which a
# defect, e.g., a vacancy or an impurity atom, is inserted.
#
# The calculation thus corresponds to a periodic arrangement of
# defects. Accordingly, care must be taken to keep the interactions
# between defects as small as possible, which generally calls for large
# supercells. Thus the typical goal for generating the simulation supercell
# for defect calculations is to maximize the defect-defect separation in
# *all* directions, for a reasonable number of atoms (and thus computational
# cost). In principle, we can do a good job of this by using a supercell
# with a suitable shape.
# To illustrate this for different lattices, we build and plot
# three 2D lattices with identical
# unit cell area but
# different lattice symmetry. We build and visualize (3,3,1) supercells
# by repeating the unit cell.

# %%
#
# In the case of the square lattice, each defect has :math:`Z_1=4`
# nearest neighbors at a distance of :math:`r_1=a_0`, where
# :math:`a_0=\sqrt{A}` with :math:`A` being the unit cell area. By
# comparison in a rectangular lattice with an aspect ratio of 2:1, the
# defects are much closer to each other with :math:`r_1 = a_0/\sqrt{2}` and
# :math:`Z_1=2`, where again :math:`a_0` = :math:`\sqrt{A}`
# (the 'effective cubic length').
# The largest defect-defect distance (at constant unit
# cell area) is obtained for the hexagonal lattice, which also
# correponds to the most closely packed 2D arrangement. Here, one
# obtains :math:`r_1=\sqrt{2}/\sqrt[4]{3}=1.075 a_0` and
# :math:`Z_1=6`. For defect calculations, supercells corresponding to
# hexagonal or square lattices have thus clear advantages. This argument
# can be extended to 3D: Square lattices in 2D correspond to cubic
# lattices (supercells) in 3D with :math:`r_1=a_0` and
# :math:`Z_1=6`. The 3D analogue of the hexagonal 2D lattice are
# hexagonal and cubic close packed structures (i.e. FCC, HCP), both of which
# yield :math:`r_1 = \sqrt[6]{2} a_0 \approx 1.1225 a_0` and :math:`Z_1=12`.
#
# It is straightforward to construct cubic or face-centered cubic (fcc,
# cubic closed packed) supercells for cubic materials (including e.g,
# diamond and zincblende) by using simple repetitions of the
# conventional or primitive unit cells. For countless materials of lower
# symmetry the choice of a supercell is, however not necessarily so
# simple. The algorithm below represents a general solution to this
# issue.
#
# In the case of semiconductors and insulators with small dielectric
# constants, defect-defect interactions are particularly pronounced due
# to the weak screening of long-ranged electrostatic interactions. While
# various correction schemes have been proposed, the most reliable
# approach is still finite-size extrapolation using supercells of
# different size. In this case care must be taken to use a sequence of
# self-similar supercells in order for the extrapolation to be
# meaningful. To motivate this statement consider that the leading
# (monopole-monopole) term :math:`E_{mp}`, which scales with :math:`1/r`
# and is proportional to the (ionic) dielectric constant
# :math:`\epsilon_0`. The :math:`E_{mp}` term is geometry dependent and
# in the case of simple lattices the dependence is easily expressed by
# the Madelung constant. The geometry dependence implies that different
# (super)cell shapes fall on different lines when plotting e.g., the
# formation energy as a function of :math:`N^{-1/3}` (equivalent to an
# effective inverse cell size, :math:`L^{-1} \propto N^{-1/3}`. For
# extrapolation one should therefore only use geometrically equivalent
# cells or at least cells that are as self-similar to each other as
# possibly, see Fig. 10 in [Erhart]_ for a very clear example. In this
# context there is therefore also a particular need for supercells
# of a particular shape.
#
#
# Algorithm for finding optimal supercell shapes
# ----------------------------------------------
#
# The above considerations illustrate the need for a more systematic
# approach to supercell construction. A simple scheme to construct
# "optimal" supercells is described in [Erhart]_. Optimality here
# implies that one identifies the supercell that for a given size
# (number of atoms) most closely approximates the desired shape, most
# commonly a simple cubic or fcc metric (see above). This approach
# ensures that the defect separation is large and that the electrostatic
# interactions exhibit a systematic scaling.
#
# The ideal cubic cell metric for a given volume :math:`\Omega` is simply
# given by :math:`\Omega^{1/3} \mathbf{I}`, which in general does not
# satisfy the crystallographic boundary conditions. The :math:`l_2`-norm
# provides a convenient measure of the deviation of any other cell
# metric from a cubic shape. The optimality measure can thus be defined
# as
#
# .. math::
#   \Delta_\text{sc}(\mathbf{h}) = ||\mathbf{h} - \Omega^{1/3} \mathbf{1}||_2,
#
# Any cell metric that is compatible with the crystal symmetry can be
# written in the form
#
# .. math:: \mathbf{h} = \mathbf{P} \mathbf{h}_p
#
# where :math:`\mathbf{P} \in \mathbb{Z}^{3\times3}` and
# :math:`\mathbf{h}_p` is the primitive cell metric.  This approach can
# be readily generalized to arbitrary target cell metrics. In order to
# obtain a measure that is size-independent it is furthermore convenient
# to introduce a normalization, which leads to the expression
# implemented here, namely
#
# .. math::
#   \bar{\Delta}(\mathbf{Ph}_p) =
#   ||Q\mathbf{Ph}_p - \mathbf{h}_\text{target}||_2,
#
# where `Q = \left(\det\mathbf{h}_\text{target} \big/
# \det\mathbf{h}_p\right)^{1/3}` is a normalization factor.  The
# matrix :math:`\mathbf{P}_\text{opt}` that yields the optimal cell
# shape for a given cell size can then be obtained by
#
# .. math:: \mathbf{P}_\text{opt} =
#   \underset{\mathbf{P}}{\operatorname{argmin}}
#   \left\{ \bar\Delta\left(\mathbf{Ph}_p\right) | \det\mathbf{P}
#   = N_{uc}\right\},
#
# where :math:`N_{uc}` defines the size of the supercell in terms of the
# number of primitive unit cells.
#
#
# Implementation of algorithm
# ---------------------------
#
# For illustration consider the following example. First we set up a
# primitive face-centered cubic (fcc) unit cell and visualize it.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

from ase.build import bulk
from ase.visualize.plot import plot_atoms

conf = bulk('Au')


fig, ax = plt.subplots()
plot_atoms(conf, ax)
ax.set_axis_off()

# %%
# Then, we call
# :func:`~ase.build.find_optimal_cell_shape` to obtain a
# :math:`\mathbf{P}` matrix that will enable us to generate a supercell
# with 32 atoms that is as close as possible to a simple cubic shape:
import numpy as np

from ase.build import find_optimal_cell_shape
from ase.build.supercells import eval_length_deviation

P1 = find_optimal_cell_shape(conf.cell, 32, 'sc')
print(P1)

# %%
#
# More nicely rendered, this yields
#
# .. math:: \mathbf{P}_1 =
#   \left(\begin{array}{rrr} -2 & 2 & 2 \\ 2 & -2 & 2 \\
#   2 & 2 & -2 \end{array}\right) \quad
#   \mathbf{h}_1 = \left(\begin{array}{ccc} 2 a_0 & 0 & 0 \\
#   0 & 2 a_0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 2 a_0 \end{array}\right),
#
# where :math:`a_0` =4.05 Å is the lattice constant. This is indeed the
# expected outcome as it corresponds to a :math:`2\times2\times2`
# repetition of the *conventional* (4-atom) unit cell. On the other hand
# repeating this exercise with:

P2 = find_optimal_cell_shape(conf.cell, 495, 'sc')
print(P2)

# %%
# yields a less obvious result, namely
#
# .. math:: \mathbf{P}_2 =
#   \left(\begin{array}{rrr} -6 & 5 & 5 \\ 5 & -6 & 5 \\
#   5 & 5 & -5 \end{array}\right)
#   \quad
#   \mathbf{h}_2 = a_0
#   \left(\begin{array}{ccc} 5 & 0 & 0 \\ 0.5 & 5 & 0.5 \\
#    0.5 & 0.5 & 5 \end{array}\right),
#
# which indeed corresponds to a reasonably cubic cell shape. One can
# also obtain the optimality measure :math:`\bar{\Delta}` by executing:
dev1 = eval_length_deviation(np.dot(P1, conf.cell))
dev2 = eval_length_deviation(np.dot(P2, conf.cell))
print(f'The length deviation for P_1 is {dev1}')
print(f'The length deviation for P_2 is {dev2}')

# %%
# which yields :math:`\bar{\Delta}(\mathbf{P}_1)=0` and
# :math:`\bar{\Delta}(\mathbf{P}_2)=0.0192`.
#
# Since this procedure requires only knowledge of the cell metric (and
# not the atomic positions) for standard metrics, e.g., fcc, bcc, and
# simple cubic one can generate series of shapes that are usable for
# *all* structures with the respective metric. For example the
# :math:`\mathbf{P}_\text{opt}` matrices that optimize the shape of a
# supercell build using a primitive FCC cell are directly applicable to
# diamond and zincblende lattices.
#
# For illustration, the :math:`\bar{\Delta}` values for supercells of SC, FCC
# and BCC lattices with SC/FCC target shapes are shown as a function of
# the number of unit cells :math:`N_{uc}\leq2000` in the panel below (taken
# from :mr:`3404`). The algorithm is, however, most useful for
# non-cubic cell shapes, for which finding several reasonably sized cell
# shapes is more challenging, as illustrated for a hexagonal material
# (LaBr\ :sub:`3`) in [Erhart]_.

#    For unit cells with more complex space groups,
#    this indirect cell-metric approach may not give the best possible
#    result (i.e. minimum image distance). The `doped <https://doped.readthedocs.io>`__`

#    `algorithm <https://doped.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doped.utils.html#doped.utils.supercells.find_ideal_supercell>`__

# Generation of supercell
# -----------------------
#
# Once the transformation matrix :math:`\mathbf{P}` it is
# straightforward to generate the actual supercell using e.g., the
# :func:`~ase.build.cut` function. A convenient interface is provided by
# the :func:`~ase.build.make_supercell` function, which is invoked as
# follows:

from ase.build import make_supercell

conf = bulk('Au')
P = find_optimal_cell_shape(conf.cell, 495, 'sc')
supercell = make_supercell(conf, P)

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
